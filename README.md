# Personal Library Project

I am learning the MERN stack by creating an online library for books written by ethnic minority authors.

I typically take notes whilst working on projects to help consolidate knowledge, and give insight into my learning processes.

You can check out the notes for this project here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aA2rwq5gwYfF_dgcNj_AKd0XkX15oOwkLGfmPQwRah0/edit?usp=sharing
